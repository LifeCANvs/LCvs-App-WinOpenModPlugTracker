flac 1.4.0.
The FLAC package has been left pretty much untouched, except for a few changes:
 *  In `include/share/compat.h`, the Windows XP compatibility warning has been
    disabled.
 *  https://github.com/xiph/flac/issues/433 has been fixed.
 *  All modifications have been marked with "/* OpenMPT */".
 *  Obviously, unnecessary folders and files (documentation, makefiles, etc.) have
    been removed.
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
